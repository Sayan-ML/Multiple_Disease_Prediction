🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction System
An integrated Machine Learning and Deep Learning based web application that predicts multiple diseases including:

❤️ Heart Disease

🩺 Diabetes

🧪 Kidney Disease

🌫️ Pneumonia (via Chest X-rays)

👁️ Diabetic Retinopathy (via Retinal Images)

Built using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and Streamlit, this system provides a one-stop solution for early disease detection through both clinical parameters and medical imaging.

📌 Features
✅ Tab-based navigation for each disease prediction
✅ Real-time predictions with user-friendly input interface
✅ Tabular models for Diabetes, Heart, and Kidney prediction
✅ CNN-based image classification for Pneumonia & Retinopathy
✅ Streamlined preprocessing and model inference
✅ Clear results with optional model confidence scores
✅ Beautiful, responsive UI using Streamlit
